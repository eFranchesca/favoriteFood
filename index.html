  <h1>Barbecue</h1>
  <h3>The reason that BBQ is my favorite food is that there is so many different styles, you can find barbecue all around the world.</h3>

      <h4 title="Barbeque is a style of indirect cooking that uses live fire and smoke to heat food. Most countries and regions have a distinct barbecue tradition. In North America, pitmasters BBQ foods by roasting or smoking them over wood or charcoal at low temperatures for several hours, transforming whole roasts and tough cuts into tender, succulent pieces of meat. Because the cooking process, equipment, and meals are so entwined they are all referred to as BBQ. You can accurately barbeque ribs, get the heat going on the barbeque, and enjoy a plate of barbequed chicken. Grammarians would tell you barbeque is a verb, noun, and adjective. American pitmasters know it‚Äôs a way of life."

          <h4 title="In the American tradition, there are four prominent BBQ regions: Kansas City, Carolina, Memphis, and Texas. These four barbeque styles represent the most recognized regional renditions of smoked meat. Their prefered cuts of meat and choice of sides vary from region to region. You will find each style's techniques, rubs, and sauces copied across the U.S."

          <h4 title="Often thought of as the origin of the word barbecue, barbacoa is a Spanish name given to an indigenous Caribbean cooking style. After migrating to Mexico, barbacoa meant the cooking of a whole sheep wrapped in maguey leaves and slowly cooked over an open fire pit in Central Mexico. Other areas of Mexico, like the Yucatan Peninsula use pork, whereas northern Mexico use beef or goat head."

          <h4 title="The Mongolian style of barbecue is Khorkhog. Bone-in cuts of meat such as mutton, lamb, or goat are layered into a large metal jug lined with vegetables (cabbage, potatoes, onions, and carrots) and hot stones. Unlike other cooking methods that require a fire, Khorkhog requires you to pour water into the jug causing steam. Lidded, the combination of the steam and hot stones cooks the meat into a dry stew that you can eat with your hands."
